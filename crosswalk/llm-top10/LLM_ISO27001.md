# LLM Top 10 2025 × ISO/IEC 27001:2022

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
to [ISO/IEC 27001:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/82875.html) — the world's most
widely deployed information security management system standard,
certified by over 70,000 organisations globally.

ISO 27001:2022 is the baseline certification for enterprise supplier
assessments, regulated industry compliance, and public sector
procurement worldwide. Its 2022 revision introduced 11 new Annex A
controls — including A.8.11 data masking, A.8.12 data leakage
prevention, A.5.7 threat intelligence, and A.8.28 secure coding —
that map directly to LLM application security requirements.

This file covers LLM01–LLM10 mapped to ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls.
For the DSGAI 2026 × ISO 27001 mapping covering the full GenAI data
security surface, see `dsgai-2026/DSGAI_ISO27001.md`.

### LLM01 — Prompt Injection

**Severity:** Critical

Malicious instructions in user input or processed content manipulate
LLM behaviour, bypassing safety controls and executing unauthorised
actions. ISO 27001 addresses this through secure coding requirements,
security testing, threat intelligence, and monitoring controls.

**Real-world references:**
- EchoLeak (2025) — indirect injection via email turned Microsoft 365
  Copilot into a silent exfiltration engine
- Samsung source code leak (2023) — proprietary code surfaced through
  manipulated model queries

#### ISO 27001:2022 mapping

| Control | ID | Domain | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Secure coding | A.8.28 | Technological | Secure coding requirements for all LLM integration code — input validation, sanitisation, context separation |
| Security testing | A.8.29 | Technological | Adversarial testing programme covering prompt injection scenarios before each release |
| Threat intelligence | A.5.7 | Organisational | Active intelligence on prompt injection techniques — new attack patterns inform detection controls |
| Monitoring activities | A.8.16 | Technological | Runtime monitoring for prompt injection indicators in LLM inputs and outputs |

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational**
- A.8.28: Implement input validation and prompt structure
  enforcement as secure coding requirements — enforce through
  code review and CI/CD gates, not just guidelines
- A.5.7: Subscribe to threat intelligence feeds covering
  prompt injection techniques — new methods inform filter
  updates and adversarial test cases
- Treat all external content processed by the LLM as untrusted —
  documents, emails, web results, and RAG chunks regardless
  of source

**Hardening**
- A.8.29: Include prompt injection scenarios in security
  testing programme — direct, indirect, and jailbreak vectors
  tested before each production release
- A.8.16: Deploy runtime monitoring for injection indicators
  on all input channels — alerts integrated into incident
  management workflow
- Implement architectural separation between system prompt
  and user input — structural control at the code level

**Advanced**
- A.8.29: Extend adversarial testing to cover your specific
  RAG sources, tool descriptors, and document processing
  pipelines — not just generic injection scenarios
- A.5.7: Use threat intelligence to drive quarterly red team
  exercises — novel injection techniques tested before they
  reach production
- Document prompt injection controls in ISMS as a formal
  security objective with measurable targets

### LLM02 — Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High

LLMs expose PII, financial data, proprietary code, or confidential
information through outputs — from training data memorisation,
over-permissive RAG retrieval, or improperly sanitised responses.

**Real-world references:**
- Samsung source code leak (2023)
- Multiple healthcare RAG deployments surfacing PHI through
  over-permissive vector store retrieval (2024)

  users should only retrieve documents they are authorised
  to access, enforced at the retrieval layer
- A.8.12: Deploy DLP on all model output channels — scan
  for PII and sensitive patterns before responses are delivered

**Hardening**
- A.8.11: Implement output redaction for sensitive patterns —
  PII, API keys, internal system names masked before responses
  leave the LLM service boundary
- Audit RAG access controls per sprint — verify retrieval
  scope matches authorised user access rights
- Classify embeddings and derived assets at the same level
  as source documents — A.5.12 propagation requirement

**Advanced**
- Apply differential privacy in training and embedding
  generation for sensitive corpora — document as A.8.11
  technical control evidence
- Conduct model inversion red team exercises — validate that
  sensitive training data cannot be reconstructed from outputs
- A.8.12: Implement real-time DLP with automated blocking —
  not just alerting — on sensitive pattern detection

### LLM03 — Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

**Severity:** High

LLM applications depend on third-party model weights, fine-tuned
adapters, training datasets, libraries, and plugins — any of which
can be compromised to introduce backdoors or malicious functionality.

**Real-world references:**
- Multiple malicious models with embedded backdoors uploaded to
  public model repositories (2024)

### LLM04 — Data and Model Poisoning

**Severity:** Critical

Attackers inject malicious data into training datasets or fine-tuning
pipelines — corrupting model behaviour in ways baked into the weights
and invisible to standard testing until a trigger condition is reached.

**Real-world references:**
- Nightshade (2023) — poison pixels in training images corrupted
  image generation model behaviour
- Adversarial examples achieving 35% success rate influencing
  model outputs even with defensive mechanisms

| Backup | A.8.13 | Technological | Backup and recovery for LLM service infrastructure — failover capability tested |
| Incident management | A.5.24 | Organisational | Incident response procedures for LLM availability failures and cost overruns |

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational**
- A.8.16: Implement real-time monitoring of LLM resource
  consumption — API token usage, compute cost, request
  rates — with automated alerting on anomalous spikes
- Implement rate limiting per user, session, and API key —
  hard caps enforced before requests reach the model
- Set hard token limits on input and output per request —
  reject requests exceeding thresholds at the API gateway

**Hardening**
- A.5.30: Include LLM services in BCP — define RTO and RPO,
  implement circuit breakers, test failover procedures
- A.5.24: Define incident response for consumption anomalies —
  automated rate limit tightening, session suspension, cost
  circuit breakers, owner notification workflow
- Implement per-tenant cost budgets with automatic suspension
  on breach — not just alerting

**Advanced**
- A.8.16: Deploy sponge example detection — identify inputs
  statistically designed to maximise token consumption and
  reject before inference
- Conduct adversarial cost-maximisation testing — identify
  inputs generating maximum token consumption for your model
  and guard those paths
- A.5.30: Include LLM availability SLAs in operational policy —
  reviewed quarterly against actual consumption data

## Implementation priority

| Phase | LLM entries | Controls | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Do now | LLM01, LLM06, LLM07 | A.8.28, A.8.2, A.5.12 | Highest exploitability, most active in wild |
| 2 — This sprint | LLM02, LLM05 | A.8.11/A.8.12, A.8.26 | Data exposure and output handling close common breach paths |
| 3 — This quarter | LLM03, LLM04 | A.5.19/A.5.21, A.8.27 | Supply chain and poisoning require pipeline-level changes |
| 4 — Ongoing | LLM08, LLM09, LLM10 | A.8.16, A.5.30, A.6.3 | Monitoring, resilience, and training hardening |
