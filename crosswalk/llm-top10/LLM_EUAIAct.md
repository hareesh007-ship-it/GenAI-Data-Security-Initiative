# LLM Top 10 2025 × EU AI Act

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
to the [EU Artificial Intelligence Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1689)
(Regulation EU 2024/1689), which entered into force August 1, 2024.

The EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive binding legal framework
for AI. It applies to any provider, deployer, importer, or distributor
placing AI systems on the EU market or putting them into service in the EU
— regardless of where the organisation is headquartered. Non-compliance
carries fines up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover.

## Risk classification — where do LLMs sit?

| Classification | Definition | LLM examples |
|---|---|---|
| Prohibited (Art. 5) | Banned regardless of safeguards | Social scoring, real-time biometric surveillance, subliminal manipulation |
| High-risk (Annex III) | Permitted with strict obligations | LLMs in employment decisions, credit scoring, education assessment, critical infrastructure, law enforcement, justice |
| GPAI model (Art. 51–55) | General purpose AI model obligations | Any LLM with >10^25 FLOPs training compute (systemic risk tier) or released via API/open weights |
| Limited risk (Art. 50) | Transparency obligations only | Chatbots, deepfake generators — must disclose AI nature |
| Minimal risk | No specific obligations | Most narrow-purpose AI tools |

**GPAI note:** Most commercially deployed LLMs fall under GPAI obligations
from August 2025. All providers must publish technical documentation,
comply with copyright law, and implement information security policies.
Systemic risk models (GPT-4 class and above) face additional adversarial
testing and incident reporting obligations.

### LLM01 — Prompt Injection

**Severity:** Critical
**Applies to:** High-risk AI systems · GPAI models with systemic risk

Malicious instructions in input or processed content manipulate LLM
behaviour, bypassing safety controls. The EU AI Act directly mandates
cybersecurity and robustness measures for high-risk systems and
adversarial testing for systemic risk GPAI models — both directly
applicable to prompt injection.

#### EU AI Act mapping

### LLM02 — Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High
**Applies to:** High-risk AI systems · GPAI models · Limited risk systems · GDPR intersection

LLMs expose PII, financial data, or proprietary information through
outputs. This sits at the intersection of the EU AI Act and GDPR —
both apply simultaneously and both impose binding obligations on
providers and deployers.

**GDPR intersection:** Where sensitive information disclosed by an LLM
includes personal data, GDPR Articles 5, 25 (data protection by design),
and 32 (security of processing) apply in addition to the EU AI Act.
Non-compliance with both simultaneously is possible from a single
incident.

### LLM10 — Unbounded Consumption

**Severity:** Medium
**Applies to:** High-risk AI systems · GPAI models

Adversarial inputs cause resource exhaustion or denial of service.
The EU AI Act requires high-risk AI systems to be resilient and
available, with documented quality management covering operational
continuity.

#### EU AI Act mapping

| Article | Obligation | How it applies |
|---|---|---|
| Art. 9 — Risk management | Availability risks identified and mitigated | Resource exhaustion and DoS scenarios included in risk management system |
| Art. 15 — Accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity | High-risk AI must remain available under adversarial conditions | Technical resilience against denial-of-service attacks is an Art. 15 requirement |
| Art. 17 — Quality management | Operational continuity procedures documented | Post-market monitoring and incident response for availability failures required |

#### Compliance obligations by tier

**Foundational**
- Art. 9: Document resource exhaustion as a foreseeable risk —
  include in risk management system with treatment controls assigned
- Implement rate limiting per user, session, and API key —
  basic Art. 15 cybersecurity measure

**Hardening — required for high-risk AI systems**
- Art. 15: Implement and document technical resilience measures —
  rate limiting, token limits, cost budgets — as Art. 15 cybersecurity
  evidence for conformity assessment
- Art. 17: Establish post-market monitoring for availability
  incidents — SLA metrics, incident detection, and response
  procedures documented
- Define and document RTO/RPO for high-risk LLM services as
  Art. 17 quality management requirements

**Advanced**
- Art. 15: Conduct adversarial cost-maximisation testing — document
  results as robustness evidence
- Implement adaptive rate limiting with real-time load awareness —
  document as Art. 15 cybersecurity measure
- Art. 17: Include availability SLAs in post-market monitoring
  programme — reviewed quarterly against actual operational data

## Compliance readiness checklist

Use this checklist to assess your current EU AI Act posture
against the OWASP LLM Top 10:

### August 2025 — GPAI obligations (already in force)

- [ ] Determine if your LLM qualifies as a GPAI model (Art. 51)
- [ ] If GPAI: publish technical documentation (Art. 53(1)(a))
- [ ] If GPAI: implement copyright compliance policy (Art. 53(1)(c))
- [ ] If GPAI: establish information security policy (Art. 53)
- [ ] If systemic risk: register with EU AI Office (Art. 55)
- [ ] If systemic risk: adversarial testing programme live (Art. 55(1)(b))
- [ ] All chatbots: AI disclosure implemented (Art. 50)

### August 2026 — High-risk obligations (4 months away)

- [ ] Determine if your LLM qualifies as high-risk (Annex III)
- [ ] Art. 9 risk management system documented and live
- [ ] Art. 10 data governance policy documented
- [ ] Art. 13 technical documentation complete
- [ ] Art. 14 human oversight measures implemented and tested
- [ ] Art. 15 cybersecurity and robustness measures documented
- [ ] Art. 17 quality management system operational
- [ ] Conformity assessment completed (self-assessment or third-party)
- [ ] EU Declaration of Conformity signed
- [ ] CE marking applied (where applicable)
- [ ] Registration in EU AI database completed
