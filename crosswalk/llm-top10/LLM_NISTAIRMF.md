# LLM Top 10 2025 × NIST AI RMF

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
to the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/26/AI%20RMF%201.0.pdf)
and its companion [NIST AI RMF Playbook](https://airc.nist.gov/Docs/2).

The NIST AI RMF is the primary governance framework for trustworthy AI
in the United States and is widely adopted globally by enterprises,
government agencies, and critical infrastructure operators. It organises
AI risk management across four core functions — GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE,
MANAGE — each with subcategories that map directly to LLM security controls.
US federal agencies are required to align with the AI RMF under Executive
Order 14110. It is the foundational framework for enterprise AI governance
programmes and pairs directly with NIST CSF 2.0 for organisations already
using the cybersecurity framework.

### LLM01 — Prompt Injection

**Severity:** Critical

Malicious instructions in user input or processed content manipulate
LLM behaviour, bypassing safety controls and executing unauthorised
actions. The NIST AI RMF addresses this primarily through governance
of input handling policies, risk measurement of adversarial inputs,
and managed response to injection incidents.

**Real-world references:**
- EchoLeak (2025) — Microsoft 365 Copilot turned into silent
  exfiltration engine via indirect prompt injection
- Samsung source code leak (2023) — proprietary code surfaced
  through manipulated model queries

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

  evaluation programme — test direct, indirect, and jailbreak vectors
  before each production release
- MG-2.2: Define and test incident response runbooks for prompt

### LLM02 — Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High

LLMs expose PII, financial data, proprietary code, or confidential
information through outputs — from training data memorisation,
over-permissive RAG retrieval, or improperly sanitised responses.
The AI RMF addresses this through data governance policies, privacy
risk measurement, and managed data protection controls.

**Real-world references:**
- Samsung source code leak (2023)
- Multiple healthcare LLM deployments surfacing PHI through
  over-permissive RAG retrieval (2024)

### LLM03 — Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

**Severity:** High

LLM applications depend on third-party model weights, datasets,
libraries, and plugins — any of which can be compromised to introduce
backdoors or malicious functionality. The AI RMF addresses this through
supply chain risk governance, dependency mapping, and third-party
risk management.

  model weights, datasets, and libraries, with sign-off requirements
  before production use
- MP-5.1: Maintain a complete ML SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
  for every production AI system — model, adapters, datasets, libraries
- Pin all dependency versions — never pull latest in production
  without review and sign-off

### LLM04 — Data and Model Poisoning

**Severity:** Critical

Attackers corrupt training data or fine-tuning pipelines to embed
backdoors or bias model behaviour in ways baked into the weights and
invisible to standard testing. The AI RMF addresses this as a core
data quality and adversarial evaluation requirement.

**Real-world references:**
- Nightshade (2023) — poison pixels successfully corrupted image
  generation model behaviour

  anomaly detection, source validation, and lineage tracking before
  any training run

  registry with ability to revert to a known-clean checkpoint on
  poisoning detection
- Apply differential privacy during training to limit the influence
  of any single training example

**Advanced**

### LLM05 — Insecure Output Handling

**Severity:** High

LLM-generated output passed to downstream components without
validation enables XSS, command injection, SSRF, or SQL injection
via AI-generated content. The AI RMF addresses this through output
evaluation requirements and managed response to output-related incidents.

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational**

  as untrusted input by downstream systems — encoding, validation,
  and sanitisation mandatory before rendering or execution
- MS-2.5: Include output injection scenarios in your AI evaluation
  programme — XSS, SQL injection, command injection via LLM output
- Never pass raw LLM output directly to database queries, shell
  commands, or eval functions — policy enforced at code review

**Hardening**

  every release evaluation — not just at initial deployment
- MG-2.2: Define incident response for output injection events —
  what is isolated, how is impact assessed, what is user notification

  all interfaces that consume LLM output — include in CI/CD pipeline
- Deploy dedicated output security layer between LLM and all
  downstream consumers, independent of the model

### LLM06 — Excessive Agency

**Severity:** High

LLMs granted excessive autonomy over tools, APIs, and systems execute
unintended or harmful actions when manipulated. The AI RMF addresses
this through governance of AI decision authority, human oversight
requirements, and managed response to autonomous action incidents.

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

  decision authority permitted for each LLM deployment, requiring
  human approval for irreversible or high-impact actions
- MP-2.3: Map all tool and API integrations to risk levels — include

  evaluation — verify that the model cannot exceed its defined
  permission scope even under adversarial input
- MG-2.2: Establish automated response to detected unauthorised
  autonomous actions — session isolation, owner notification,
  action rollback where feasible
- Log all tool invocations with full parameter capture — feed into
  AI risk monitoring programme

**Advanced**
- GV-1.7: Include AI autonomy limits in board-level AI governance
  reporting — autonomous action scope changes require executive
  sign-off
- MS-2.5: Conduct red team exercises specifically targeting
  excessive agency through indirect prompt injection
- Formally specify permitted action graphs — only pre-approved
  action sequences can execute in production

### LLM07 — System Prompt Leakage

**Severity:** High

System prompts containing internal instructions, business logic, or
security controls are extracted by adversaries — enabling targeted
attacks against specific defences. The AI RMF addresses this through
confidentiality policies, configuration security testing, and
managed disclosure response.

#### NIST AI RMF mapping

### LLM08 — Vector and Embedding Weaknesses

**Severity:** Medium

Weaknesses in embedding stores enable adversarial retrieval
manipulation, inference of sensitive information from embeddings,

| Risk categorisation | MP-2.3 | MAP | Embedding and vector store risks mapped in AI system risk register |

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational**

  AI risk register

**Hardening**

### LLM10 — Unbounded Consumption

**Severity:** Medium

Adversarial inputs trigger disproportionate resource consumption —
CPU, memory, tokens, API costs — causing denial of service or

## Implementation priority aligned to AI RMF

| Phase | GV — Govern | MP — Map | MS — Measure | MG — Manage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Now | GV-1.7 autonomy and input policy | MP-2.3 risk register all 10 entries | MS-2.5 adversarial testing LLM01/04/06 | MG-2.2 incident response LLM01/04 |
| 2 — This sprint | GV-1.6 data classification policy | MP-5.1 SBOM and dependency mapping | MS-2.6 output and leakage testing | MG-2.4 data incident response |
| 3 — This quarter | All GV policies reviewed and approved | MP-2.3 full risk register complete | MS-3.3 data quality controls live | MG-3.2 residual risk documentation |
| 4 — Ongoing | Board-level AI risk reporting | Dependency map refreshed quarterly | MS-4.1 production feedback loops | All MG procedures exercised |

## AI RMF profiles

The NIST AI RMF supports the creation of AI risk profiles —
current state vs target state assessments. For LLM deployments,
a starter profile mapping all 10 OWASP entries to AI RMF subcategories
is available at:
`data/llm-top10/nist-aiRMF-profile.json`

This can be used directly in AI RMF-aligned governance programmes
and compliance assessments.
