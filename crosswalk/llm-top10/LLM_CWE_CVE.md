# LLM Top 10 2025 × CWE / CVE

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/)
to the [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)](https://cwe.mitre.org/) taxonomy and
documented [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/) entries.

CWE provides root-cause weakness classifications maintained by MITRE and used as
the foundation for vulnerability databases, SAST tools, and secure coding standards.
Mapping LLM risks to CWE entries enables security teams to connect GenAI threats to
the same weakness taxonomy already used for bug tracking, tool configuration, and
compliance reporting. CVE entries provide confirmed real-world evidence of exploitation.
