#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational (IG1)**

  tool returns, email, web results regardless of source
- Implement kill switch accessible from operator console

**Hardening (IG2)**
- CIS 16.1: Establish secure coding standards covering
  agentic integration — goal-state verification and
  input validation as mandatory requirements reviewed
  in code review for all agent-related PRs
- CIS 13.8: Deploy network monitoring covering agent
  traffic — injection indicators in agent communications
  detected and alerted
- Runtime goal-state verification — agent declares
  goal at session start, deviation triggers suspension

  direct, indirect via RAG, indirect via tool returns,
  multi-turn attacks tested against your specific
  deployment

### ASI03 — Identity & Privilege Abuse

**Severity:** Critical

Agents inherit and cache credentials exploited for lateral movement.
CIS Controls 5 (account management) is the primary control — agent
NHIs are accounts requiring the same management rigour as human accounts.

#### CIS Controls mapping

| Control | Safeguard | IG | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| CIS 5 — Account Management | 5.4 Restrict administrator privileges | IG1 | Agent credentials managed as privileged accounts — minimum scope, regular review, JIT issuance |

### ASI04 — Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

**Severity:** High

Compromised tools, MCP servers, or model components alter agent
behaviour. CIS Controls 2 (software asset inventory) and 7 (vulnerability
management) govern agent components as software assets.

#### CIS Controls mapping

| Control | Safeguard | IG | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| CIS 2 — Inventory and Control of Software Assets | 2.1 Establish and maintain software inventory | IG1 | ML SBOM as software asset inventory — all agent components (tools, MCP servers, models, libraries) |

  every agent component (tools, MCP servers, model weights,
  libraries) inventoried with version, source, hash
- CIS 7.1: Include agent component CVEs in vulnerability

### ASI05 — Unexpected Code Execution

**Severity:** Critical

Agents that generate and execute code become RCE gateways. CIS Controls

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational (IG1)**
- CIS 4.1: Secure configuration baseline includes code
  execution sandbox — no unrestricted shell access from
  agent context, enforced at deployment
- Avoid deploying agents with code execution capability —
  strongest control, should be the default position

**Hardening (IG2)**
- CIS 16.1: Implement sandbox, static analysis, and
  allowlist as secure development requirements — all
  code execution capability in agents requires these
  controls before deployment review approval

  environments — outbound network attempts from sandbox
  detected and blocked, alerted

**Advanced (IG3)**
- CIS 18.1: Include sandbox escape in penetration testing —
  attempt escape from within specific runtime, document
  results, retest after any sandbox configuration change
- Hardware-level sandboxing for highest-risk deployments —
  gVisor or Firecracker as advanced configuration control

| CIS 13 — Network Monitoring | 13.3 Deploy a network-based intrusion detection system | IG2 | Memory store access monitored — bulk read, anomalous write patterns detected |

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational (IG1)**
- CIS 3.11: Encrypt all agent memory stores at rest —
  embedding databases, long-term memory, operational
  knowledge base all encrypted
- CIS 8.2: Log all memory write operations — source
  identity, timestamp, content hash — audit trail
  enabling poisoning investigation
- Enforce memory TTL — entries expire requiring
  re-validation, no indefinite persistence

**Hardening (IG2)**
- CIS 16.1: Memory write validation as secure development
  requirement — untrusted sources cannot write to memory
  without explicit validation and approval
- CIS 13.3: Monitor memory store access patterns —

A2A channels lacking authentication enable agent-in-the-middle attacks.
CIS Controls 12 (network infrastructure management) and 3 (data protection)
govern A2A communication as network traffic requiring encryption and
integrity controls.

#### CIS Controls mapping

| Control | Safeguard | IG | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| CIS 12 — Network Infrastructure Management | 12.4 Establish and maintain architecture diagram | IG2 | A2A communication channels mapped in network architecture — authentication method, encryption status |

### ASI08 — Cascading Agent Failures

**Severity:** High

Single-point faults propagate through multi-agent workflows.
CIS Controls 4 (secure configuration) and 12 (network infrastructure)

### ASI09 — Human-Agent Trust Exploitation

**Severity:** Medium

Agents build false trust enabling manipulation of human approvers.
CIS Controls 14 (security awareness) is the primary control — trust
exploitation is fundamentally a people risk addressed by training.

#### CIS Controls mapping

| Control | Safeguard | IG | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|

### ASI10 — Rogue Agents

**Severity:** Critical

Compromised agents pursue hidden goals while appearing compliant.
CIS Controls 8 (audit log management) and 13 (network monitoring)

| CIS 18 — Penetration Testing | 18.1 Establish penetration testing | IG3 | Rogue agent scenarios in penetration testing — persistent hidden goal simulation, detection verification |

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational (IG1)**
- CIS 8.2: Comprehensive audit logging of all agent
  actions — no production agentic deployment without
  full observability, non-negotiable IG1 requirement
- CIS 17.2: Rogue agent containment as incident response
  procedure — kill switch activation, recommendation
  audit, process state validation, forensic capture
  documented before deployment

  behavioural baseline deviation events fed into SIEM,
  tiered response automated

  detects systematic bias before operational harm

**Advanced (IG3)**
- CIS 18.1: Rogue agent scenarios in penetration testing —
  simulate persistent hidden goal pursuit across extended
  sessions, verify detection capability holds, document
  results
- CIS 18.3: Remediate and retest after rogue agent
