# Agentic Top 10 2026 × ISO/IEC 27001:2022

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/)
to [ISO/IEC 27001:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/82875.html) —
the world's most widely deployed information security management
system standard.

## Why ISO 27001 for agentic AI

ISO 27001 is the baseline certification for enterprise security
programmes globally. Agentic AI deployments introduce new ISMS
scope questions that must be resolved before controls can be
selected:

**Scope extension:** Every autonomous agent that stores, processes,
or transmits information is an information asset within the ISMS
scope. Agent memory stores, credential vaults, A2A communication
channels, and tool integration APIs all require Annex A controls.

**New 2022 controls:** The 11 new Annex A controls introduced in
ISO 27001:2022 map directly to agentic risks — A.5.23 (cloud
services security), A.8.11 (data masking), A.8.12 (DLP), A.8.16
(monitoring activities), and A.8.23 (web filtering) all have
direct agentic application.

**NHI as privileged access:** Under ISO 27001, every agent service
account, API key, and OAuth token is a privileged access credential
subject to A.8.2 (privileged access rights) — the same controls
that govern human privileged access apply to agent NHIs.

**Supply chain:** ISO 27001 A.5.19–A.5.22 (supplier relationships)
applies to all agent tool providers, MCP server vendors, and model
component suppliers. Agents that load tools at runtime create new
supplier relationships that the ISMS must track.

### ASI01 — Agent Goal Hijack

**Severity:** Critical

An attacker redirects agent objectives through direct or indirect
instruction injection. ISO 27001 addresses this through secure coding
(A.8.28), security testing (A.8.29), monitoring (A.8.16), and
threat intelligence (A.5.7).

#### ISO 27001:2022 mapping

| Control | ID | Domain | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Secure coding | A.8.28 | Technological | Secure coding requirements for all agentic integration code — input validation, goal-state verification, context separation |
| Security testing | A.8.29 | Technological | Adversarial testing programme covering goal hijack — direct, indirect, multi-turn injection before each release |
| Monitoring activities | A.8.16 | Technological | Runtime monitoring for injection indicators across all agent input channels — new 2022 control |
| Threat intelligence | A.5.7 | Organisational | Active intelligence on prompt injection and goal hijack techniques — new attack methods inform detection controls |

### ASI02 — Tool Misuse & Exploitation

**Severity:** Critical

Agents misuse legitimate tools via prompt manipulation or unsafe
delegation. ISO 27001 A.8.2 (privileged access rights) governs tool
permissions as privileged access — the same controls that prevent
humans from misusing privileged access apply to agent tool scope.

#### ISO 27001:2022 mapping

| Control | ID | Domain | How it applies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Privileged access rights | A.8.2 | Technological | Agent tool access managed as privileged access — per-tool permission manifests, minimum scope, regular review |
| Identity management | A.5.15 | Organisational | Agent tool access governed through identity management — tool permissions scoped per agent identity |
| Logging | A.8.15 | Technological | All tool invocations logged with full context — tool identity, parameters, agent identity, timestamp |
| Secure coding | A.8.28 | Technological | Tool parameter validation as secure coding requirement — LLM-generated parameters treated as untrusted |

#### Mitigations by tier

**Foundational**
- A.8.2: Manage agent tool access as privileged access —
  per-tool permission manifests enforced, minimum scope,

  coding requirement — all LLM-generated parameters
  validated before tool execution
- A.8.29: Include tool misuse in security testing —
  destructive parameters, tool chain exploitation,
  MCP descriptor poisoning tested before each release

**Advanced**
- A.8.2: Include agent tool access in privileged access
  reviews — quarterly, any permission not actively used
  is removed, documented as ISMS evidence
- A.8.29: Red team tool chain exploitation — attempt
  destructive outcomes through legitimate tool sequence,
  results documented in ISMS

### ASI03 — Identity & Privilege Abuse

**Severity:** Critical

Agents inherit and cache credentials that attackers exploit for
lateral movement. ISO 27001 A.8.2 (privileged access) and A.5.16
(identity management) govern the full NHI lifecycle — the same
controls that govern human privileged access apply to agent identities.

  layer — rogue agent cannot exceed permission envelope,
  managed as privileged access control
- A.5.24: Rogue agent containment procedure as ISMS
  incident management — kill switch, audit, state
  validation, forensic capture documented

**Hardening**
- A.8.16: Establish behavioural baseline and continuous
  monitoring — baseline documented during commissioning,
  deviation triggers tiered ISMS response
- Aggregate recommendation analysis — periodic review
  detects systematic bias as A.8.16 monitoring control
- A.5.24: Include rogue agent drills in ISMS incident
  response exercises — annual testing of containment
  procedure documented as evidence

**Advanced**
- A.8.29: Rogue agent red team exercises — simulate
  persistent hidden goal pursuit across extended
  sessions, verify detection capability holds, results
  in ISMS security testing records
- A.8.16: Integrate behavioural anomaly detection into
  ISMS SIEM — rogue agent indicators trigger A.5.24
  incident response automatically

## ISO 27001 ISMS extension checklist for agentic AI

### Scope and asset management

- [ ] All agents added to A.5.9 asset inventory — identity, tool scope, memory stores
- [ ] All agent NHIs inventoried as privileged access credentials (A.8.2)
- [ ] All agent memory stores inventoried as information assets (A.8.3)
- [ ] All A2A communication channels documented as network assets (A.8.20)
- [ ] All agent component vendors added to supplier register (A.5.19)

### Policy and governance

- [ ] AI acceptable use policy updated to cover agentic AI autonomy scope (A.5.10)
- [ ] Agent tool permission policy published — what requires human confirmation (A.5.15)
- [ ] A2A information transfer policy documented (A.5.14)
- [ ] Advisory vs authoritative output classification policy (A.5.12)

### Technical controls

- [ ] Agent credentials managed as privileged access — JIT, minimum scope (A.8.2)
- [ ] Agent NHI identities managed through formal process (A.5.16)
- [ ] Agent credentials encrypted at rest (A.8.24)
- [ ] Memory stores access-controlled and encrypted (A.8.3, A.8.24)
- [ ] A2A channels mutually authenticated and encrypted (A.8.24, A.8.20)
- [ ] DLP extended to agent memory write paths (A.8.12)

### Testing and monitoring

- [ ] Goal hijack in security testing programme (A.8.29)
- [ ] Tool misuse in security testing programme (A.8.29)
- [ ] Sandbox escape in security testing programme (A.8.29)
- [ ] Supply chain integrity in security testing programme (A.8.29)
- [ ] Behavioural baseline established during commissioning (A.8.16)
- [ ] Continuous behavioural monitoring live for all agents (A.8.16)
- [ ] A2A channel anomaly monitoring live (A.8.16)
- [ ] Cascade detection monitoring live (A.8.16)

### Incident management and BCP

- [ ] Rogue agent containment procedure in ISMS incident management (A.5.24)
- [ ] Goal hijack response procedure in ISMS (A.5.24)
- [ ] Cascade incident response in ISMS (A.5.24)
- [ ] Agent cluster failures covered in BCP (A.5.30)
- [ ] Kill switch tested and documented as BCP control (A.5.30)

### Training and awareness

- [ ] All agentic system operators trained on AI limitations (A.6.3)
- [ ] Trust exploitation awareness in security training programme (A.6.3)
- [ ] Supplier security requirements applied to all agent component vendors (A.5.19)

## Implementation priority

| Phase | ASI entries | Controls | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Privileged access | ASI03, ASI02 | A.8.2, A.5.16 | NHI governance and tool permission are the fastest impact controls |
| 2 — Monitoring | ASI10, ASI01 | A.8.16, A.8.15 | Behavioural baseline and logging close the rogue agent and injection blind spots |
| 3 — Supply chain | ASI04 | A.5.19/A.5.21 | Vendor requirements for all agent component providers |
| 4 — BCP and testing | ASI08, ASI05 | A.5.30, A.8.29 | Resilience and adversarial testing programme |
| 5 — Ongoing | ASI06, ASI07, ASI09 | A.8.24, A.6.3 | Cryptographic controls, training, and A2A hardening |
