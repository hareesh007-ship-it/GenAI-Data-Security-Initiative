# DSGAI 2026 × AIUC-1

Mapping the [OWASP GenAI Data Security Risks 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-genai-data-security-risks-mitigations-2026/)
(DSGAI01–DSGAI21) to [AIUC-1](https://www.aiuc-1.com/) — the world's
first AI agent security, safety and reliability certification framework,
developed with 100+ Fortune 500 CISOs.

AIUC-1 is an OWASP GenAI Security Project partner. Its six domains
(Data & Privacy, Security, Safety, Reliability, Accountability, Society)
map directly to the data security concerns across the DSGAI taxonomy —
Domain A (Data & Privacy) alone covers a majority of the 21 DSGAI entries.
