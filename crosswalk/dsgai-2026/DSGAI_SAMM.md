# DSGAI 2026 × OWASP SAMM v2.0

Mapping the [OWASP GenAI Data Security Risks 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-genai-data-security-risks-mitigations-2026/)
(DSGAI01–DSGAI21) to the [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) v2.0](https://owaspsamm.org/) —
the framework for measuring and improving software security programme
maturity across the software development lifecycle.

## Why SAMM for GenAI data security

The DSGAI taxonomy documents 21 data-oriented risks that emerge when
organisations build, deploy, and operate GenAI systems. SAMM is the
right lens for these risks because it answers a question that pure
control frameworks cannot: **how mature does our security programme
need to be before we can safely operate these data flows?**

Three SAMM properties are especially valuable for DSGAI:

**Data governance is a SAMM Design problem.** DSGAI's risks — from
training data poisoning (DSGAI02) to RAG corpus manipulation
(DSGAI09) to model weight theft (DSGAI14) — originate in design
decisions made before a single line of production code is written.
SAMM Design practices (D-TA, D-SR, D-SA) provide the structured
approach to catching these risks early.

**Implementation practices determine data pipeline security.** DSGAI
data risks live in pipelines: ingestion, preprocessing, embedding,
training, retrieval. SAMM's Implementation function (I-SB, I-SD)
provides the maturity model for securing these pipelines.

**Operations maturity determines detection and response.** DSGAI
risks often manifest as subtle degradation — poisoned embeddings,
drifting model behaviour — rather than hard failures. SAMM Operations
practices (O-IM, O-OM, O-EM) provide the monitoring and incident
response maturity to detect and respond.

### DSGAI14 — Model Weight Theft

Adversaries gain access to proprietary model weights through
infrastructure compromise, insider threat, or API extraction —
stealing intellectual property and enabling fine-tuned attack models
that bypass original safety controls.

#### SAMM mapping

### DSGAI15 — Inference Data Exposure

Input data submitted to GenAI systems at inference time — queries,
documents, user data — is logged, retained, or used in ways that
expose it to unauthorised parties, including third-party model
providers, logging infrastructure, or analytics systems.

### DSGAI16 — Third-Party Data Dependencies

GenAI systems depend on external data sources — APIs, data brokers,
open datasets, web scraping — whose quality, security, or availability
cannot be guaranteed, introducing poisoning, quality degradation, or
supply chain risks.

### DSGAI18 — Data Retention and Deletion Failures

GenAI systems retain personal data, training artefacts, or inference
logs beyond required retention periods — or fail to honour deletion
requests — creating regulatory violations and unnecessary exposure.

#### SAMM mapping
