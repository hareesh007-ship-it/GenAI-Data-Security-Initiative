# DSGAI 2026 – DORA

Mapping the [OWASP GenAI Data Security Risks 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/dsgai-2026/)
to the [Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2554/oj)
(EU Regulation 2022/2554, effective 17 January 2025).

DORA establishes a binding regulatory framework for digital operational
resilience across the EU financial sector. For financial entities managing
AI data security, DORA requires that data-related risks — including data
poisoning, leakage, privacy erosion, third-party data dependency, and
governance failures — are integrated into ICT risk management, incident
reporting, resilience testing, and third-party oversight. The DSGAI 2026
mapping focuses on the data security dimensions critical to the EU financial
sector: from training data provenance and integrity, through access control
and privacy preservation, to data retention, consent management, and
cross-jurisdictional compliance. Financial institutions deploying generative
AI must ensure that AI data security risks are treated as first-class
concerns within the DORA ICT risk management framework, incident management
processes, resilience testing programmes, and third-party oversight
arrangements. This mapping enables financial institutions to trace each
OWASP DSGAI risk to specific DORA articles and implement controls satisfying
both data security and operational resilience regulatory obligations.

### DSGAI01 – Data Access Logging

**Severity:** High

Insufficient logging of data access events in AI systems prevents detection
of unauthorised access, complicates forensic investigation, and undermines
regulatory audit readiness. DORA requires financial entities to identify
and classify AI data assets (Art. 8), implement protection controls for
data access (Art. 9), deploy detection mechanisms for data access anomalies
(Art. 10), and report material data access incidents to regulators
(Art. 17–23). Without comprehensive logging, financial institutions cannot
demonstrate compliance with DORA operational resilience requirements.

**Real-world references:**
- Capital One breach (2019) – misconfigured access controls and inadequate
  logging allowed mass data exfiltration to go undetected
- SolarWinds (2020) – insufficient access logging delayed identification
  of supply chain compromise across financial institutions

### DSGAI02 – Data Visibility

**Severity:** High

Lack of visibility into what data AI systems process and how it flows
through training, fine-tuning, and inference pipelines. DORA requires
governance covering data visibility (Art. 5–7) and asset identification
including data stores and pipelines (Art. 8). Without visibility, financial
entities cannot assess data-related risks, enforce data policies, or
demonstrate regulatory compliance.

**Real-world references:**

### DSGAI03 – Shadow AI

**Severity:** High

Unauthorised or unvetted AI tools and services bypass data security
controls, creating unmonitored data flows and regulatory exposure. DORA
requires third-party ICT risk management covering AI tools (Art. 28–44),
identification of all ICT assets including shadow AI services (Art. 8),
and governance policies for approved AI tools (Art. 5–7). Shadow AI in
the financial sector creates uncontrolled data processing that evades
both DORA and GDPR oversight.

**Real-world references:**
- Samsung semiconductor division employees leaked proprietary data through
  unauthorised ChatGPT usage (2023)
- Multiple banks reported shadow AI tool proliferation across trading
  desks and operations teams (2024–2025)

### DSGAI04 – Data/Artifact Poisoning

**Severity:** Critical

Attackers corrupt training data, model weights, or pipeline artefacts to
embed backdoors, bias outputs, or degrade model reliability. DORA requires
financial entities to implement protection controls for training pipeline
integrity (Art. 9), conduct resilience testing including data poisoning
scenarios (Art. 24–27), and maintain backup and restoration capabilities
for AI data and models (Art. 12). In the financial sector, poisoned models
could produce fraudulent risk assessments, manipulated trading signals,
or biased credit decisions.

**Real-world references:**
- Nightshade (2023) – poison pixels successfully corrupted image generation
  model behaviour at scale
- BadNets (academic) – backdoor triggers embedded through poisoned training
  labels, activating only on specific inputs

### DSGAI05 – Data Provenance

**Severity:** High

Insufficient provenance tracking for AI data undermines trust in model
outputs and prevents regulatory audit of data sources. DORA requires
asset identification covering data sources (Art. 8), protection controls
for data quality and integrity (Art. 9), and third-party oversight for
external data sources (Art. 28–44). In the financial sector, unverified
data provenance can lead to models trained on inappropriate, inaccurate,
or legally restricted data.

**Real-world references:**
- EU AI Act Article 10 requirements for training data documentation
  prompted financial institutions to audit AI data provenance (2025)
- Several financial AI vendors found to have used scraped data without
  proper licensing or provenance documentation

### DSGAI06 – Data Lineage

**Severity:** Medium

Incomplete data lineage across AI pipelines prevents tracing how data is
transformed, combined, and consumed by models. DORA requires asset
identification covering data transformations (Art. 8), backup policies
including lineage metadata (Art. 12), and governance for lineage
requirements (Art. 5–7). Lineage gaps in financial AI systems prevent
impact analysis when data quality issues or poisoning events are detected.

### DSGAI07 – Excessive Aggregation

**Severity:** High

AI data aggregation creates combined datasets with higher sensitivity than
individual sources, enabling re-identification and inference attacks. DORA
requires governance covering aggregation risk (Art. 5–7) and protection
controls for aggregation boundaries (Art. 9). In the financial sector,
aggregation of customer transaction data, behavioural patterns, and
external data can create datasets that significantly exceed the sensitivity
of the originals.

### DSGAI08 – Data Leakage

**Severity:** Critical

Sensitive data exposed through model outputs, training data extraction,
misconfigured data stores, or uncontrolled inference pipelines. DORA
requires protection controls preventing data disclosure (Art. 9), incident
reporting for data breaches (Art. 17–23), and detection for leakage
indicators (Art. 10). Data leakage from financial AI systems may expose
PII, credit data, trading strategies, or regulatory-protected information.

**Real-world references:**
