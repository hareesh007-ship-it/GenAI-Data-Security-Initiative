# DSGAI 2026 × CIS Controls v8.1

Mapping the [OWASP GenAI Data Security Risks & Mitigations 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-genai-data-security-risks-mitigations-2026/)
(DSGAI01–DSGAI21) to the [CIS Controls v8.1](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls)
— the Center for Internet Security's prioritised set of cyber defence safeguards,
organised into 18 control groups with Implementation Groups (IG1/IG2/IG3) scaling
from small organisations to enterprise security programmes.

CIS Controls are the most action-oriented security framework available — every
safeguard names a specific tool, activity, or configuration to implement. For
DSGAI risks, the most critical controls are data protection (CIS 3), access control
(CIS 6), audit log management (CIS 8), application software security (CIS 16),
and service provider management (CIS 15) — covering the full GenAI data lifecycle
from training through inference.

---

## CIS Controls structure

| Group | Controls | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Basic hygiene (IG1) | CIS 1–6 | Asset inventory, data protection, secure config, account management, access control |
| Foundational (IG2) | CIS 7–11 | Vulnerability management, audit logs, malware, network monitoring |
| Organisational (IG3) | CIS 12–18 | Network monitoring, security awareness, app security, incident response, pen testing |

**Implementation Groups:**
- IG1 — Essential cyber hygiene, all organisations
- IG2 — IG1 + additional controls for organisations handling sensitive data
- IG3 — IG2 + advanced controls for enterprise and regulated industries
