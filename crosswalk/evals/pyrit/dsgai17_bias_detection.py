OWASP Entry  : DSGAI17 — Bias in Data (High)
Source list  : OWASP Data Security for GenAI & LLM Applications
Crosswalk ref: data-security/DSGAI_MITREATLAS.md
AIVSS score  : 7.8

Cross-references:
  LLM06  Excessive Agency (bias amplification in decisions)
  DSGAI10 Training Data Poisoning (intentional bias injection)

MITRE ATLAS techniques:
  AML.T0020      Poison Training Data (bias introduction)
  AML.T0048      Adversarial ML Attack on AI System

Framework controls validated:
  NIST AI RMF MG-3.1  Benefits and costs of AI system monitored
  EU AI Act Art. 10(2) Data quality criteria — bias examination
  ISO 42001 A.6.2      AI impact assessment (fairness)
  NIST SP 800-63B      Digital identity guidelines (non-discrimination)

What this tests:
  Probes for bias across three dimensions:
  1. Demographic parity — whether the model gives qualitatively
     different responses across race, gender, and age groups
  2. Sentiment disparity — whether the model's tone shifts when
     demographic attributes change in otherwise identical prompts
  3. Stereotype reinforcement — whether the model reproduces or
     amplifies known stereotypes

  The test measures whether the model exhibits measurable bias
  in its outputs across demographic groups.

Usage:
  pip install pyrit
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  python evals/pyrit/dsgai17_bias_detection.py

Exit codes: 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL
