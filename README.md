# OWASP GenAI Data Security Initiative

Part of the [OWASP GenAI Security Project](https://genai.owasp.org/) · [Data Security Initiative Page](https://genai.owasp.org/initiative/data-security/)

---

## Overview

The OWASP GenAI Data Security Initiative focuses on the data security risks and best practices specific to Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, and Agentic AI systems. As AI systems create new data surfaces — prompts, context windows, embeddings, vector stores, agent traces, tool payloads — and new failure modes — prompt-driven extraction, cross-session bleed, inference attacks, plugin and tool data drains — traditional data security frameworks no longer map cleanly to what needs protection.

This initiative produces community-developed, peer-reviewed guidance to help organizations understand and address these emerging data security challenges. All materials are released under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode).

## Key Deliverables

### GenAI Data Security Risks and Mitigations 2026 (v1.0)

📄 [Download PDF](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-genai-data-security-risks-mitigations-2026/) · Released March 2026

A focused enumeration of 21 data security risks specific to GenAI systems, each with tiered mitigations (Foundational → Hardening → Advanced) designed to support organizations at different stages of security maturity. This is not a Top 10 — it is a comprehensive, structured risk taxonomy following data as it moves through a GenAI system.

Aligned with and cross-referenced to the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/) and the [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/initiatives/agentic-security-initiative/).

### LLM and GenAI Data Security Best Practices 2025 (v1.0)

📄 [Download PDF](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/llm-and-gen-ai-data-security-best-practices/) · Released February 2025

The companion implementation guide covering practical data security principles, secure deployment architectures, monitoring and auditing guidelines, governance models, and future trends. Topics include data minimization, encryption strategies, access control for LLM pipelines, securing data flows in LLM agents, and regulatory compliance alignment.

## Workstreams

### 1. Data Collection

Public open call for real-world data on vulnerabilities and risks associated with LLMs and GenAI applications. This workstream supports future iterations of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications and related guidance by gathering incident data, vulnerability reports, and field observations from the global community.

Community members are encouraged to submit data through the Slack channel or by opening an issue in this repository.

### 2. Mapping

Mapping of the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/) and the [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/initiatives/agentic-security-initiative/) to recognized cybersecurity frameworks and standards, including NIST CSF 2.0, NIST AI RMF, MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE ATLAS, ISO/IEC 42001, CIS Controls, and others.

Full mapping files are maintained in the [`/mappings`](./mappings) directory. See the [Framework Mappings](#framework-mappings) section for the complete list of mapped frameworks.

### 3. Data Security Risks and Best Practices

Research, authoring, and maintenance of the initiative's two published white papers:

- **GenAI Data Security Risks and Mitigations 2026** — The 21-entry DSGAI risk taxonomy with tiered mitigations
- **LLM and GenAI Data Security Best Practices 2025** — The companion implementation and governance guide

This workstream also maintains alignment with the broader OWASP GenAI Security Project deliverables and ensures cross-references to the LLM Top 10 and Agentic Top 10.

### 4. Community Datasets

Development of open, community-contributed datasets to support research, benchmarking, and practical security testing for GenAI data security. This workstream covers both the curation of existing datasets and the creation of new ones addressing gaps in the current landscape. See the [`/datasets`](./datasets) section for current and proposed datasets.

### 5. Data Validation

Automated and peer-reviewed validation of all data collected and contributed to the initiative. Scripts in the [`/data_validation`](./data_validation) directory ensure integrity and accuracy. All submissions are also subject to manual verification by cybersecurity and AI security experts.

## Datasets

### Current

- **Vulnerability Dataset** — Real-world vulnerabilities affecting LLM applications
- **Exploit Dataset** — Documented exploits and attack techniques targeting LLMs
- **Risk Assessment Dataset** — Mapped risk assessments for various LLM deployments

### Proposed Community Datasets

We are looking for contributors to help build datasets that the broader AI security community can use. Priority areas include:

- **GenAI Data Security Incident Database** — A structured, anonymized catalog of real-world data security incidents in GenAI deployments (leakage events, cross-tenant bleed, RAG exfiltration, agent credential exposure). Modeled on existing incident databases but focused specifically on the data security failure modes enumerated in DSGAI01–DSGAI21.
- **Prompt Injection & Data Extraction Test Cases** — A curated set of adversarial prompts and extraction techniques mapped to the DSGAI risk taxonomy, usable for red-teaming and regression testing of data security controls.
- **RAG Poisoning & Retrieval Integrity Dataset** — Benign and adversarial document sets for testing vector store integrity controls, retrieval-time redaction, and poisoning detection pipelines.
- **Cross-Framework Control Mapping Dataset** — A machine-readable mapping of DSGAI risks to controls across NIST CSF 2.0, NIST AI RMF, MITRE ATLAS, ISO/IEC 42001, and the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications — enabling automated compliance gap analysis.
- **Agent Data Flow & Tool Exchange Traces** — Sanitized traces of agentic AI tool calls, plugin data exchanges, and delegation chains to support research into DSGAI06 (tool/plugin data exchange risks) and related agent security patterns.

If you are interested in contributing to any of these datasets, please join the Slack channel or reach out directly.
